# radio-wave-activity-detection
This repository contains the code and dataset for activity recognition using mmWave radar sensors. The dataset was collected in two different environments with 23 subjects and includes range and micro-Doppler inputs. Additionally, there is an alternative task of human micro-Doppler generation using GANs.
