TODO:
    - [DONE] complete the implementation of the function crop_mDoppler
    and crop_rdn in preprocessing/DataReader.py
    - [DONE] complete the implementation of the function padding_rdn,
    padding_mDoppler, cut_time in preprocessing/DataProcess.py
    - [DONE] complete the implementation of the functions of
    preprocessing/dataset.py
    - check the parameters of CNN-MD in models/cnn_md.py
    - [DONE - TO BE CHECKED] copy-paste the code of models/cnn_md.py
    in models/cnn_rdn.py and modify the parameters
    - [DONE] complete the functions
    in models/classifier.py
    - [DONE] write the main function in ./train.py
    - [DONE] run the code in and check the results
    - [DONE] complete the augmentation by resampling
    - implementation of the functions to augment the dataset
    - [DONE] add check after augmentation to avoid repetition of the same
    sample in the training set
    - correct the model in models/cnn_rdn.py to have the same
    architecture as the one in models/cnn_md.py
